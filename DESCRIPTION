Description: Allows the user to create standardized '2dii' graphs that are
    used internally by analysts, for example in metareport, stress tests, 
    impact analysis, and outputs them as 'ggplot' objects. It also contains 
    data processing functions that prepare the data to be an input for the 
    plotting functions.
